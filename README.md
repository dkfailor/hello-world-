Revised "Hello World" repository for Odin web learning.
My name is David and I have been playing with "all things computer" for over 30 years now.  I consider myself more of a generalist or "hacker" than an expert in any one field.  I've worked with most programming languages and operating systems and even published a couple of books on computer security.  In my spare time I teach IT classes in the evening for local Universities.
